# AdGuard's filter for PiHole

In this is a project to make AdGuard and AdGuard Home's filtering rule useable with PiHole

Please note, I only check if there is a new rule on AdGuard's filtering domain (https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt) and write it as for Pi-Hole's filtering rules as can be seen on
`PiholeAdServers.txt`

The filter I am using is a default filter for [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) and for the public [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) servers.

# Important Note:
`PiHoleTestList.txt` contains a full list of domains by AdGuard's Database. Use it at your own risk
